# MSP430FR2355-Comm-Protocols

This document consists of random projects containing UART, SPI, and I2C protocol algorithms in C utilizing the MSP430FR2355 Launchpad development board. This is a self-directed learning repo for me to learn embedded C. 

All projects within this repo are learned from the textbook "Embedded Systems Design by Brock LaMeres" and lecture videos in the following playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL643xA3Ie_EuHoNV7AgvJXq-z1hrE8vsm&si=BD7X46wQDGY8TBP3
